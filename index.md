# Bioplotting Intestinal Crypts
<p style="text-align: center;">
  
_To date, there is not a single, in vivo or animal study model that can recapitulate the complexity of the architecture, luminal accessibility, tissue polarity, cell migration, and cellular responses of in vivo intestinal crypts in the normal and diseased gastrointestinal tract._ _**Here, we present the design of a bioplotter for creation of crypt structures within transwells which, when seeded with intestinal stem cells, should achieve complexity highly representative of the human intestines.**_
