# Mechanical Assembly for Bioplotter

## Bioplotter Overview
The _BioFAB Four Crypt Plotter_ is designed to achieve high resolution 3-dimensional bioprinting. The design is intended for printing hydrogel-based structures for the creation of intestinal crypt models within transwells. Yet, the bioplotter has intentionally been crafted for translation to alternative uses. Features that enable translation include:
- a print bed that exceeds the size necessary for crypt printing
- a larger range of motion for the print head provided by the corexy and z-direction stage motion
- interchangeable syringes for easy change between printed materials
- fast print times due to the lightweight carriage containing only the print head in the corexy system
- an awesome design to look good in any research laboratory, makerspace, or garage (depending on your taste)!
