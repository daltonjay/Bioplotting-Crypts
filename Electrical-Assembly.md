# Electrical Assembly for Bioplotter

![Electrical diagram featuring the general layout of control and components.](/Bioplotting-Crypts/BioPics/finalelectricaldiagram.png)

# General Overview

Few specialty components are required for our bioplotter. Rather, standard NEMA 17 stepper motors, inexpensive drivers, and a single Arduino Uno are necessary to construct this device. 

Note: Due to the scale of the Transwell prints, resolution and stability of motion are necessary over speed, so it is recommended a further 3 digital pins are reserved to enable microstepping on the controllers.
