## Peregrine Liu

## Nicole D. Muszynski

Nicole works as a Biomedical Engineer for the Dept of Physics at Vanderbilt University (May 2011 - Present). Her research includes work in Superconductors, Microfluidics, Clinical Pharmacology and Gastroenterology. She is affiliated with the VIIBRE lab led by John P. Wikswo and the Gastrointestinal SQUID Technologies Lab led by L. Alan Bradshaw. Currently, she is working with John Wikswo on rapidly identifying molecular mechanism of action in Organ-on-a-Chip bioreactors.

## Dalton J. Nelson

Dalton is a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University. As a member of the Haselton Lab, Dalton's research focuses on the development of infectious disease diagnostics for resource-constrained settings. His current work is on the development of nucleic acid based assays for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms indicative of states of interset (e.g., HIV drug resistances). However, Dalton's interest span across many areas related to biomedical engineering and beyond, including mathematics, scientific computing, electronics, and philosophy. Dalton loves to run, bike, hike, and argue for sport.
